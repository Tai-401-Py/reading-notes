## Wireframe and Design
---

What is a wireframe
- UX design to outline how something should look
    - Typically done on paper or a whiteboard in order to make quick changes at first then switched to software later.

Wireframe Uses
- Gives a live version of what it might look like
- Easier to change on paper than when code is being written
- Switching later to software can allow you to keep more detailed revisions

Considerations before wireframing
- Done in many different ways, with different flows. 
    - Wireframe>Interactive Prototype>Visual>Design
    - Sketch > Code
    - Sketch > Wireframe > Cleaned (High Def) Wireframe > Visual > Code
    - Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code
- The more that the user interfaces with the element typically the longer the process.

Steps to making a proper wireframe
1. Do your research
  - User Personas (Who is going to use the product)
  - Trends (What is working for a lot of other people)
  - Best Practices
  - Features
2. Prepare your research for quick reference
  - Quick refernce user and business goals
  - User feedback 
3. Map out your flow
  - How many screens do you need


4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch don't illustrate
  - This is a mockup, use place holders when possible
5. Add Detail and Test
  - Inuitive interface for navigation
  - Where do elements go to
6. Start Turning wireframes into prototypes

## HTML Basics

- HTML is the written language of the internet that structures it
- it is comprised of elements which tell browsers how to interpret and display information
  - Parts of an element 
    - Opening tag
    - Closing tag
    - The content
    - The element
- Often used in conjuntion with .css to make it look pretty

>HTML is a lot of review for me so parts of it and building webpages is something I know how to generally do.


## Semantics in HTML
---

- There are several semantic elements in HTML such as `<h1>` tag, by default most browser will read this tag just fine
- There are other ways to accomplish the same thing, but are much longer and unnecessarry.
- Search engines use semantic elements for keyword searches
- Screen readers use them to navigate pages
- Finding blocks of code beccomes easier without the need to sort through every `<div>`
- There are roughly 100 semantic elements
- `<em>` and `<strong>` should be used for extra emphasis instead of `<i>` or `<b>`
