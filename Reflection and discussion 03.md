### Version control
---

What is version control, well it's a catalogue of revisions made. So you can go back and look at what was done. 

- Local Version control
  - Revisions stored on a local database (hard drive) for easy recall
  - Allows for singular control of revisions
- Centralized Version Control
  - Revisions stored on a central database such as a server for easy access by numerous parties
  - Allows for numerous people to work together
- Distributed Version Control
  - Uses mirrored(duplicated) repositories to store revisions, to be merged at a later date
  - Allows many teams to work in tandem
  - Prvents data loss by having multiple copies of full revision history across multiple devices
  
### Git

Git is a DCVS (Distributed Version Control System) that stores revisions in snapshots.
