# What is cloud computing?

## How do websites work?
---

Client will use network to route packets to server and it will reply send the information back. In order to view a website

In order to find the server and the server to find you, they use an IP address. This is similar to a physical mailing address, it gives it a location for it to route to your destination. 

A server is composed of a CPU and RAM - Compute + MEmory = BAsically together they make a brain. 

Storage: Data -> Files
More structured = Database: Stores data in a structured way.

Traditionally, people would start by making a server in a garage. It would grow then you'd move to an office and then you'd have a data center.

Problems with this is that you have to pay rent, pay for power, cooling, and maintenance. 
Adding and removing Servers takes time.
Scaling becomes limited.
You need to hire a 24/7 team to monitor infrastructure.

How do we solve this -> Cloud computing.
