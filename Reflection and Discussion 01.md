Markdown is a simple language that allows users to quickly transform text into readble HTML format by web browsers. 
You may have used this format of language if you've ever posted on Reddit, 
or chatted in Discord, without ever knowing about it. 
Maybe you've done some simple editing like *italicizing* `*italicizing*` with a pair of asterisks, 
or maybe you format your chatting differently by double spacing your sentences to add new lines. 

Like creating this new line here. 

There are many different styles of markdown that you can use in order to create the type of text your want. 

`# header1` Will create
># header1

`*italicize*`
>*italicize*

`**Bold**`
>**Bold**

These are just some examples of markdown.
