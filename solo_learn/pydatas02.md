# Working with Lists

---

### 1.1 Lists

Lists are used to store multiple elements, each corresponding to an index.

They are stored in square brackets 
`names = ["James", "Tom", "Amy"]`

Indexing starts at `[0]` -> James

List can also be presented as matrices. 

```py
m = [
    [a,b,c],
    [d,e,f]
    ] 
```

where `m[1][0]` -> d

### List Operations

Similar to strings you can use **in** and **not in** to check if an element is part of a list. -> This returns a boolean value.

Similar to strings we can loop through elements of a list. 

`for x in y:` -> Will iterate over y calling x as the object in the list
