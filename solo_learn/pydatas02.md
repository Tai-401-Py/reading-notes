# Working with Lists

### 1.1 Lists

Lists are used to store multiple elements, each corresponding to an index.

They are stored in square brackets 
`names = ["James", "Tom", "Amy"]`

Indexing starts at `[0]` -> James

List can also be presented as matrices. 

```py
m = [
    [a,b,c],
    [d,e,f]
    ] 
```

where `m[1][0]` -> d
