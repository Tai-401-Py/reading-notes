# Working with Strings

---

- Strings are the most common and simplest data structures.
  - Any text between a double or single quot is a string

In the middle of a string you can use some special characters to add more things.

`\n` Will Generate a new line

`\t` Will tab over 4 spaces

`\` Backslash can be used as an escape character.

### 3.1 Accessing Strings

Strings can be thought of as a sequence of characters, each character of the string has an individual index and can be accessed by it. `string[0]` will access the first character of a string. Using inverse such as `string[-1]` will acess the last char.
