## Wireframe and Design
---

What is a wireframe
- UX design to outline how something should look
    - Typically done on paper or a whiteboard in order to make quick changes at first then switched to software later.

Wireframe Uses
- Gives a live version of what it might look like
- Easier to change on paper than when code is being written
- Switching later to software can allow you to keep more detailed revisions

Considerations before wireframing
- Done in many different ways, with different flows. 
    - Wireframe>Interactive Prototype>Visual>Design
    - Sketch > Code
    - Sketch > Wireframe > Cleaned (High Def) Wireframe > Visual > Code
    - Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code
- The more that the user interfaces with the element typically the longer the process.

Steps to making a proper wireframe
1. Do your research
  - User Personas (Who is going to use the product)
  - Trends (What is working for a lot of other people)
  - Best Practices
  - Features
2. Prepare your research for quick reference
  - Quick refernce user and business goals
  - User feedback 
3. Map out your flow
  - How many screens do you need


4. Draft, don't draw. Sketch don't illustrate
  - This is a mockup, use place holders when possible
5. Add Detail and Test
  - Inuitive interface for navigation
  - Where do elements go to
6. Start Turning wireframes into prototypes

## Semantics in HTML
---

There are several semantic elements in HTML such as `<h1>` tag, by default most browser will read this tag just fine
There are other ways to accomplish the same thing, but are much longer and unnecessarry
