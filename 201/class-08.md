## Basics of layout

The basics of Layout come in two forms, things that are inline, or things tha come in a block level. 

Inline items behave like words and sit next to each other on a single line. Typically preserving surrounding whitespace.

Block elements however create thier own new lines, and unless told otherwise will span the full width.

There is also now the display property which is used more frequently for styling options.

setting display property to `display: flex;` makes the box a block level element but now allows flex properties that will control alignment, order, and flow.

There are several ways to align containers through flex and grid formats. allowing you to justify and align in more ways.

for collaboration and user interfacing.
