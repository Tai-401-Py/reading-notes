## [Domain modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

When creating a single entity with many instances, create self contained attributes with same keys.

Creating new instances can be use by `new keyword callCreator();`

Prototyping takes less memory by sharing code. which is important
prototyping allows you to create new keys and values for objects

`Math.round` rounds to nearest integer.

## Tables in HTML

- `<table>` - master table creation
  - `<tr>` - Creates a new row
  - `<td>` - creates a new data poin in a new column
- spanning
  - `colspan = "#"`
  - `rowspan - "#"`
- long tables
  - `<thead>` - heading
  - `<tbody>` - body  
  - `<tfoot>` - footer
