# HTML LINK, JS FUNCTIONS, INTRO TO CSS LAYOUT

---

## HTML

### LINKS

- Links are created using the `<a>` element. You specify destination with the `<href>` tag. 
  - Text in between the `<a>` tags is the display text.
- On larger sites it is reccomended that you put each individual HTML page in a child directory. 

- When linking E-mail the href is followed by `mailto:address@site.com` 
- You can force a new window with the `target="_blank"` attribute.
- Using id tags it's possiblew to link to the same part of the same page you're in. 
-To link to a psecific part of another page you would input the destination URL with the ID tag of the portion you want to address to. 

## CSS

### Layout

- CSS treats each HTML element as it's own little box.
  - These elements willl either be block level (seperate line) or inline (same line) elements.
- When one block-level element is inside another it's a parent/containing element.

- Element positions
  - Normal Flow
    - Every block-element on a new line.
  - Relative positioning
    - Shifts element top, right, bottom, or left, of where it would have been placed.
