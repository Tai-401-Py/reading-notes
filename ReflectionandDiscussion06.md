## JavaScript

---

Javascript is logic - it is composed of actions

- A lightweight just-in-time compiled programming language.
- Most well known for web-based environment.
- JavaScript and Java are two different languages.

- Can be used inline with HTML using `<script>`
- `alert` creates a textbox
- `document.getElementById(*value*)`
- `<input id="(*variable*)">`
  - allows user input for id variables

Some .js commands  
- `window.prompt`
- `document.write('tag' + variable '/tag')`
- `let variable = prompt("prompt to display")`

## JS variables

---

Variables

- var
  - declared using var keyword
  - used between 1995 and 2015
- let
  - declared using the let keyword
  - added in 2015
- undeclared
  - x = 5;
- const
  - const variables as a general rule should be used

If you think value can change use let, else use const

- === (absolute equal directly compare, must be same type)
- == (shallow compare, as long as you equate to input in some way)
- = (set variable)
- $ recognized as a character and can be used for variables
- variables should be descriptive

---

let firstName = prompt("What's your name?");
let age = prompt('How old are you');
let petsName = prompt


Conditionals
based on something else

1 > 5 -> false
'josh' = 7 -> false
if (1< 5){
alert('this is true')
} else {
}

if conditional is true then do what is inside object bracket. 

console.log('data descriptor', variable)
