# [The Tree](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)


    Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes
    Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
    K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
    Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
    Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
    Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
    Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
    Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

There are two different ways to traverse a tree. Either from Depth first or breadth. 

- Depth Traversal can happen in 3 ways
  - Pre-order
    -Root->L->if none->go back to head and move right then left
  - In-Order
  - Post-Order

- Breadth traversal typically uses a queue. From dequeued root it enqueus left then right node if applicable. 


There are two differnt types of trees, binary which is 0/1 left or right. or K trees in which any node can have K number of nodes as leafs

Adding nodes to a tree there really is no "supposed to go" 

## Searching a Tree

Binary search trees are built a very specific way, where smaller values are placed to the left and larger are placed to the right, in this sense you will check if a numerical value is larger or smaller and traverse L-R based on data given. 

## Things I would like to know more about.

I would really like to know more about how collision and things are coded as well as how people build machine learning programs. Those seem to intruige me quite a lot.
