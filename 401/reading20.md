## What and Why of Django

Django can take web apps from concept to launch in  a matter of hours. It takes care of the hassle that is the web dev. 

Reasons to use it.
- It's fast! 
- It includes dozens of things that you can use to handle we dev like user authentication, content admin, site maps and rss feeds. 
- It's secure, 
- It's scaleable, some of the busiet sites use it to scale traffic demands.

## [Django behind the Scenes](https://wsvincent.com/how-django-works-behind-the-scenes/)

- Code was open sourced in 2005 and developers have contributed to it, with major releases every 9 months. 

- Open Source code actually costs to maintain for things like ticket triage, conferences, release managment, legal/TM issuses. 

They are funded one of three ways.

1. Corporate Sponser - A group of engineers decided to open-source internal code. E.G. REACT, ANGULAR
2. Solo - Individual developer creates the code and opensources it. 
3.Non-Profit - Djanogs approach they created the Django Software Foundation in 2008.

The DSF suports and maintains Django ina  number of capacitites, the largest expense... The Fellows Program which is a series of paid contractors who triage tickets and maange releases. 

They allso support realted projects such as Django REST framework.

They are a low cost non-profit, Their annual budget is around 200K whihc is less than the soct of a single SF Bay Engineer. 

Historically, Django followed Python's model of Benevolent Dictator for Life, that means that the originator of the code has final say for the code.
