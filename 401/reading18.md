### Encrypting

Using a letter shift cypher you can easily take a letter and substitute it with a different letter. Witht the key being the number of places the alphabet is shifted.  

### Decrypting and Cracking

there are several methods to crcking a code...

Frequency analysis - We tend to use E more commonly than any other letter, so in larger bodies of data it can be easier to find.

Known Plaintext - If you know some of the original data it becomes infinitely easier to crack teh rest of it. 

Brute force - Since there are only 25 possible iterations of the code, why not shit each attempt till the message makes sense.
