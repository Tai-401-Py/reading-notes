# SCIKIT and Linear Regression

## [Scikit-Learn](http://bigdata-madesimple.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/)

`import sklearn`

There are a lot of helpful tools in scikit-learn (sklearn). 

`_.keys()` allows you to look at a dictionary.

`_.shape` Shows you how big your data set.

`_.feature_names` Gets row title information.

`_.DESCR` Will tell you more about a dataset

`LinearRegression._` Linear regression has a lot of tools you can use and you can typically tab through them

lm - short for Linear Model

`lm._` Also has a ton of tools to look through and use tocreate your model. 

You can also use train-test models in order to improve accuracy. Scikit has a handy tool for this. 

## [Linear Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsVBBJRb9TE)

Regression analysis explores relationship between a quantitative response variable. 

X variable typically called the Explanitory Variable

Y is the response variable - Which is the one we want to explore.

There are different data  relationships including linear, and exponential, log(n), etc... regarding how data is plotted. 

Observed values will be around the line and they use an epsilon to represent the margin of error for distributions.

Estemated values typically fall along the regression line.
