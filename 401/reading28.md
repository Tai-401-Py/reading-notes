## Tips and Tricks

---

### Communicate

Don't tackle the problem right away, start asking qquestions to reallly get to know what you're doing. 

1. Restate your question and formulate your problem domain. Make sure you get an affirmative from your proctor
2. Ask about edge cases that you might need to account for
    - Nulls/exception
    - potential failings or alternate solutions
3. Ask about or get test cases
4. Write some psuedocode and ask if it makes sense
    - You may end up with a proctor who doesn't wan tto give hint and is quiet the entire time
    - HAving sound pseudocode but not knowing how to code it out is fine, this is sufficient for most companies (Knowing how to arrive at the answer even if you don't have it)
5. Write out the actual code
6. If you're really stuck... NEVER GIVE UP! ASK FOR HELP

### BONUS! 

TALK TO HR! They may have some insight into what you may be asked including language and style of question

### Take some time~

Take a little bit to collect your thoughts, make sure you let your interviewer know that you are thinking. 

### Write it down step by step

Your algorithm don't forget it! 

### Don't sweat the small stuff

These interviews are about how you think, not how perfect your code is! Sometimes you don't remember the native function/method so explain what it does, that you don't remember what it's actually called and uses some placeholder thing instead. It's even ok to say that you would look it up. 

### Review your final process! Review your final process! Review your final process! Review your final process!

Step through your solution, catach any errors in the logig, double check efficiency and see if it could be done better~ LOOK FOR MORE EDGE CASES!
