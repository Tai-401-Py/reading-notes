# Open Source Contribution

## [First timers Only!](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

This was a mabvement started by Kent C. Dodds in order to ghelp promote inclusion of new developers or even experienced ones who didn't know where to start in making contributions to open source code.  

## [What motivates a developver to contribute?](https://clearcode.cc/blog/why-developers-contribute-open-source-software/)

1. IMprovement of coding skills: The only way to perfect your craft is to continuously practice.
2. Gain Early Experience: Contributing to OSS allows developers to become better at reading code produced by others to find bugs. 
3. Increase Community and Peer Recognition: Another important aspect, self-recognition and achievement. Having your code accepted by a massive OSS project is a great acheivement
4. Greater Job prospects: OSS is visible to the public means that prospective employers can inspect your code and assess your skills as a developer based on the code you have written.
5. Improve Software on a user and business level: The desire to contribute to this particular piece of OSS stems from wanting to improve it for their own use. If a business owner or company is using a piece of open-source software and would like to make some changes or add new features to meet a certain business need, then this is also a real possibility. The result is a win-win situation, as the business gets a new feature (either by developing it themselves or suggesting it to the core team) and the software also receives a new feature that can often be utilized by other users.

Within every open-source project, the requirements for non-programming skills and contributions are just as necessary. Language translators, designers, and many other professionals can apply their skills and experience to improve OSS
