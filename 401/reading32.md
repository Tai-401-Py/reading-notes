## [Google building censored search engine](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17704526/google-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-china)

What really concerns me about this article is not the search engine itself but the drone which identifies human targes "Project Maven". Whole the ethics of censorship in the media are very grey, the reality is that if everyone were more transparent this wouldn't be an issue. I do agree that it's unethical to censor information just because it might make you look bad. That is manipulative. 


## [The Ethical Dilema of Self Driving Cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/)

In terms of ethics there is always the dillema proposed here, it's the trolly problem, do you kill one or four? How old are they, are they wealthy, are they a good person. The reality is that when it comes to self driving cars there should be one rule and it's the same one that people abide by in normal situations. Protect yourself first, then other life. Most people would rather hit a telephone pole than a child, it's the quickest way to stop. What isn't also considered is the potential mesh network of cars talking to each other which would allow all of them to brake immediately around or slow down. There are so many factors that we will never answer from a moral standpoint. One thing remains true though, we value life.
