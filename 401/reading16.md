# Serverless Computing

## What is serverless computing

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model. 

It automatically scales resources up or down based on increased or decreased demand for them. 

Serverless though is a misnomer, as ther are in fact servers involved. It's just that the enduser never sees them, they are invisible to them and they do not interact with tehm in any way shape or form. 

Serverless and Lunction as a service or (FaaS) are often conflated. Though FaaS is actually just a subset of Serverless wherin application code and containers run only in response to events/requests.

Serverless is really just outsourced server use. 

Containers are great because they simplify deployment as it can run on any underlying infrastructure. 

Though serverless is a cloud computing platform, on which you run your function. 

Some of the benefits are that you are only pay for waht you're using in the moment. Cloud provider takes care of provisioning of resources, so it's more scaleable. 

It's even faster to market, as you don't have to worry aout the backend.
