## Choosing a text editor

If you've ever wondered what tools should I use for creating code, wheter it be java, python, or even simple HTML web development. You've poroblably asked...
"What text editor is best"? If you ask around to any developers, you will likely get a lot of different answers. 

The reason for this is because they will reccomend whatever they use as "The best". There really isn't a best per se, it's simply. What works best for you.
Maybe you want something simple, that is neat and clean and doesn't have a lot going on. Maybe you want all of the extensions and add-ons to power through whatever project you're working on. Everyone has their opinions. Find what works for you.

Some things you might consider though for features.
- Code completion
- Syntax highlighting
- Variety of themes for personalization and eye strain reduction
- Extensions if you might need them

Consider these and what you or your project needs when making your decision
