    Who is Roy Fielding?

One of the people who designed the protocols for your browser to retrieve data from servers. 

    Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because there are alwyas new languages and protocols being developed to communicate differnt things. 

    What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

It's a language that is based in concepts so that all computers can agree on so when you ask for object a, you get object a even though one might be using java and then other python. 

    What does a GET do?

GET retrieves data to be used

    What does a POST do?

It adds something from one system to another

    What does PUT do?

It replaces something from one system with another thing

    What does PATCH do?

It does a partial update 


## Things I want to know more about

Server creation is something that I saw coming up and I'm really interested in that. 

I've been toying with Iconify and really interested in using that a bit more, and seeing how web applications can interact with react and other code bases.
