## NOSQL vs SQL

NOSQL

- Non-relational or distrubuted Database
- Document Based Key-Value Pairs
- Dynamic Schema
- Horizontally Scalable (More servers to reduce load on one server).
- Queries focused on collection of documents, with a varied syntax of UnQL.
- Highly preferred for large data sets, stored in key-value pairs.
- Not stable enough to handle high load and complex transactional applications

SQL 

- Relational Distributed Database
- Predefined Schema
- Vertically Scalable ( BEtter equipment rather tahn more servers)
- Uses structured language for defining and manipulating data. 
- Good for complaex Queries
- Best for heavy duty transactional applications.



    What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Relational data used to manage and organize data across multiple systems

    Give a real world example.
    
Microsoft SQL, Azure SQL
    
    What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    
Names, places, addresses  
    
    Give a real world example.
    
Medical records are a good fit for a noSQL database.    
    
    Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    
NoSQL is best for heirarchical data storage.
    
    Which type of database is best for scalability?

They are both good but in different ways, 


    What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

    What is a relational database?

A database that works with assumptions already in place. 

    What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Logical data structures - The data tables, and indexes are seperate from physical storage structures

    What is a ‘schema’?

A list of logical structures of data

    What is a NoSQL database?

A non tabular DB that stores data as documents rather than in realtional tables.

    How does it work?

Instead of tables and relations they have documents that closely resemble JSON and don't require the same schema.

    What is inside of a Mongo database?

Mongo DB stores information in BSON data, which is very similar to JSON data. 

    Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB since it requires no schema.It relies less on relations. 

    What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

Duplicate Data, you have to adjust data on every single instance that the item appears on.
