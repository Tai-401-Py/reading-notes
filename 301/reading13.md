    Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

You would use Put in order to update a record through API from HTTP

    Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

Delete and Put need IDs so they know what they are changing.

    Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST is an architectural system centered around resources and hypermedia, via HTTP protocols. CRUD is a cycle meant for maintaining permanent records in a database setting. CRUD principles are mapped to REST commands to comply with the goals of RESTful architecture ^[0]

    If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Install 
2. Create Router
3. Populate CRUD Routes in Router
4. Initiate Schema
5. Populate Database using schema

## Things I want tpo know more about 

The speedrun is of course really fast and I'd really like to know more about the middle wear people use.
