## Component-Based Arcitecture

- What is a component?
  - A modular, portable, replaceable, reusable, and self-deployable binary unit that encapsulates functionality. Intended to interact with other components, often times encapsulating a certain set of functionalitites.
- What are the characteristics of a component?
  - Reusable
    - Designed to be reused in different situations in different applications.
  - Replacable
    - Components replacable with similar components
  - Not context specific
    - Designed to operate in multiple environments.
  - Extensible
    - Can be extended from existing components to produce new behaviours. 
  - Encapsulated
    - Depicts the interfaces which allow the user to call it's functionality
  - Independent
    - Designed with minimal dependencies with other components
- What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
  - Ease of deployment
    - As new version come available it's easier to update components
  - Reduced Cost
  - Ease of Development
    - Components implement well known interfaces to provide functionality. (Development without impact to the main structure).
  - Reusable
    - can be used across several platoforms and developments to reduce costs.
  - Modification of Tech Complexity
    - A component modifies the complexity through the use of component containers
  - Reliability
    - Overall system reliability increases due to each individual component being reliable.
  - System Maintence
    - Easy to change and update implementation. 
  - Independant
    - Independancy and flexible connectivity of components.
